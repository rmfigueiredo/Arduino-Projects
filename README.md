# Arduino-Projects
Here are my mini projects made in arduino language in nodemcu esp8266 board.

## 4 LEDS site
### Description
In the web page you can select which LEDs you want to turn ON or OFF and you can see their status in the tablet app made in the Blynk app.

## Roll The Dice
### Description
This is similar to the action "Rolling one Dice" and you can see the dice and the number in the LED matrix. In the 8 segment display, you can see the number that came out the most (smaller numbers have priority).

## Temp & Hum Sensor
### Description
The nodemcu is connected to one temperature & humidity sensor that sends information to the tablet app.
Above a certain value (changable) a red light with light up.
